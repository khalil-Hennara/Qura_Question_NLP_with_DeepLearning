# mini search engine.

in this notebook, I have tried to build a mini-course for those who want to learn NLP using Deep learning.
I hope that this Notebook has a piece of good information and to learn something New.
the link to the dataset I have used  is https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs

you can get this dataset from Kaggle and use it in colab as I did or you can train directly on Kaggle.
you can choose the way you like.
we build a server on the last section from the notebook using the flask framework. 
and web Html page that takes a query and tries to predict the most similar question from the database.
anyone can use this code in any way he wants.

## how to use 
if you want to run the notebook on colab you need to install the dataset from Kaggle and put it in the drive to use it on colab or you can download it directly on colab, there are many sources about install data from Kaggle this is one of them

else if you want to train in Kaggle there is no need for this step.
then you need to install the requirement it is easy to install on colab or in Kaggle
you just need to use pip in any cell in the Notebook. 

example:
pip install nltk

next, you run the cells and train the model you can change the preprocessing step or change the structure of the model to get a better result and I recommend making your own pace of code because it is what makes you sharpen your skill.
